Welcome to my Final Project of CS50: Introduction to Computer Science.

The project is in a file called gofish.c

I used C to do a program that allows the user to simulate a Go Fish card game in different ways. 1-4 players, or just simulation.

Rules of Go Fish Card Game:

- Objective: the player with most points wins;
- Players win a point each time they have 4 cards of the same value, ex: 8C, 8D, 8H, 8S;
- One at a time asks for a card, ex: 8. If someone have a card of that value must give it to the caller;
- If the caller receives a card from an other player, it's his turn again;
- If noone has that card, the player gets a card from the table deck;
- If the card from the deck has the same value that the player asked, it's his turn again.

Modes:

- 2 players (bot vs bot);
- 2 players (player vs bot);
- 2 players (player vs player);
- 3 players (bot vs bot vs bot);
- 3 players (player vs bot vs bot);
- 3 players (player vs player vs player);
- 4 players (bot vs bot vs bot vs bot);
- 4 players (player vs bot vs bot vs bot);
- 4 players (player vs player vs player vs player).

Have fun!
